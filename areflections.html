        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Problems Observed in Nature and Computational Approaches</h2>
            <h3>Iterative Problems:</h3>
            <p>Iteration is a repeated process, such as traversing a list or performing simple calculations using loops (e.g., matrix multiplication).</p>
            <h3>Recursive Problems:</h3>
            <p>Recursion refers to the process where a function calls itself. This is used to efficiently address problems where repetition of operations is required (e.g., self-similar problems like the Towers of Hanoi, Fibonacci sequence, or tree traversal).</p>
            <h3>Backtracking Problems:</h3>
            <p>Backtracking involves trying different paths, and when a dead-end is reached, you backtrack to the last choice and try a different route (e.g., constraint-satisfaction challenges, such as solving a Sudoku or the N-Queens problem).</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Nature exhibits iterative phenomena (e.g., daily cycles), recursive patterns (e.g., fractals), and complex decisions (e.g., ant colony optimization), which are mimicked in computational problems.</p>

        <!-- Reflection 2: Space and Time Efficiency -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Space and Time Efficiency</h2>
            <h3>Definitions:</h3>
            <p><strong>Time efficiency</strong> measures how quickly an algorithm runs, often a function of input size (e.g., number of integers in a list).</p>
            <p><strong>Space efficiency</strong> measures how much memory an algorithm requires to run, excluding the space for input and output. Algorithms with negligible space complexity are considered in-place.</p>
            <h3>Importance:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Performance Analysis</li>
                <li>Algorithm Comparison</li>
                <li>Optimization and Improvement</li>
                <li>Resource Management</li>
                <li>Scalability</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Orders of Growth:</h3>
            <p><strong>Constant Growth Rate:</strong> The resource need remains constant regardless of the data size (e.g., processing one piece of data is the same as processing one million pieces).</p>
            <p><strong>Logarithmic Growth Rate:</strong> The resource needs grow by one unit for each doubling of the data (e.g., search algorithms like binary search).</p>
            <p><strong>Linear Growth Rate:</strong> The resource needs grow directly proportional to the data size (e.g., array traversal).</p>
            <p><strong>Log-Linear Growth Rate:</strong> A slightly curved line where the curve is more pronounced for lower values than higher ones (e.g., merge sort).</p>
            <p><strong>Quadratic Growth Rate:</strong> The resource needs grow exponentially as data size increases (e.g., bubble sort).</p>
            <p><strong>Cubic Growth Rate:</strong> Similar to quadratic but grows much faster (e.g., certain matrix algorithms).</p>
            <p><strong>Exponential Growth Rate:</strong> Each additional unit of data requires doubling the resources (e.g., brute-force search on large datasets).</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Balancing time and space efficiency is pivotal when optimizing algorithms, especially when deciding between recursion and iteration.</p>

        <!-- Questions to Think On -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Questions to Think On:</h2>
            <h3>1. Determining the Most Efficient Approach for Complex Problems</h3>
            <p>To solve a complex problem efficiently, it's important to first understand its requirements and constraints. Categorizing problems into iterative, recursive, or backtracking helps in selecting the appropriate method.</p>
            <p>Time and space complexities play a crucial role in this decision. For example, merge sort offers stable \(O(n \log n)\) performance but uses more memory, while quicksort is more space-efficient but can degrade to \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case.</p>
            <p>Choosing the right data structure, such as hash tables for quick lookups, is also crucial for efficient problem-solving.</p>

            <h3>2. Trade-Offs in Approaches</h3>
            <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Choosing between DFS and BFS for graph traversal.</p>
            <p><strong>DFS:</strong> Better for exploring depth; less memory-intensive.</p>
            <p><strong>BFS:</strong> Finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs but can be memory-intensive.</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The choice between DFS and BFS depends on the problem's requirements, such as memory constraints or traversal goals.</p>
